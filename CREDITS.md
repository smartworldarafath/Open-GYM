## Exercise illustrations

The exercise art in `assets/art/` comes from
[Workout Guide](https://github.com/bryllim/workout-guide) by
[Bryl Lim](https://bryllim.com), which builds on pose artwork from
[Everkinetic](https://github.com/everkinetic/data).

Both are licensed under
[CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), and GymMane's
copy stays under that same license — the rest of the app is GPLv3.

**Changes made.** Each Workout Guide frame is a 512 × 512 SVG holding a single
`<path>`. That path data was lifted into one plain-text file per exercise —
three lines, one per frame — so the app draws it with `path_drawing` and tints
it with the current theme instead of shipping a fixed-colour image. The
geometry is untouched.

Every exercise in the catalogue names the illustration it uses in its `art:`
field, and the files under `assets/art/` are named after the Workout Guide
exercise they come from, so any frame can be traced back to its original.
Several exercises share one illustration when they are the same movement done
with different equipment.
